# TheHyphenator

Despite the lack of evidence, SEO experts will tell you that you need to have hyphenated URLs for better SEO. Google also recommends hyphens at https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/76329?hl=en.

Unfortunately Rails doesn't give us a way to generate hyphenated URLs, so we built one for you.

Just install the gem and all declared URLs will be transformed to use hyphens:

```ruby
get '/my_routes', to: 'home#index' # generates a GET enabled route at /my-routes
post '/my_route/:route_id/new', as: :new_route # generates a POST enabled route at /my-route/:route_id/new named 'new_route_path'
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'the_hyphenator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install the_hyphenator

## Usage

Just install the gem.

## Development
